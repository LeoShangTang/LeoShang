The target users we converged on were university students, including both commuters and students living on campus. At the time of starting this project, our team consisted of two students, meaning that we already had some context of the student mindset going into this project. However, it was still essential to discover the thoughts and contexts of others, so we reached out to friends at UBC and other schools to gather diverse insights."
